## Setting up the car

For this project, we are working with the Donkey Car number 124. The car was used previously by other students, but we decided to flash a brand new image on the SD Card just to be sure we can start from scratch and tailor our environment for our project.

This setup is rather straightforward since Donkey Car provides a very step by step documentation on their website: http://docs.donkeycar.com

A small hiccup during the setup of the Raspberry Pi was that we misunderstood the network setting template and left some "<>" in the SSID and password definitions. It took us some time to figure out the mistake and without a working connection between the Pi and the router, we were not able to SSH into the car and perform further setup.
